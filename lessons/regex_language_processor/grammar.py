def grammar(description, whitespace=r'\s*'):
    """
    Convert a description to a grammar. Each line is a rule for a non-terminal
    symbol; it looks like this:
        Symbol => A1 A2 ... | B1 B2 ... | C1 C2 ...
        where the right-hand side is one or more alternatives, separated by the
        '|' sign. Each alternative is a sequence of atoms, separated by spaces.
        An atom is either a symbol on some left-hand side, or it is a regular
        expression that will be passed to re.match to match a token. Notation
        for *, +, or ? not allowed in a rule alternative (but ok within a
        token). Use '\' to continue long lines. You must include spaces or tabs
        around '=>' and '|'. That's within the grammar description itself. The
        grammar that gets defined allows whitespace between tokens by default,
        specify '' as the second argument to grammar() to disallow this (or
        supply any regular expression to describe allowable whitespace between
        tokens).
